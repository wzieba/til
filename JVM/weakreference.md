# WeakReference

**Weak Reference**
> A **weak reference** is a reference made that is not strong enough to make the object to remain in memory. So, weak references can let the garbage collector decide an objectâ€™s reachability and whether the object in question should be kept in memory or not.
>
> Weak references need to be declared explicitly as by default Java marks a reference as a strong reference.

**Reference Queue**
> (...) **reference queue** is a way for the GC to inform the program that a certain object is no longer reachable.

> If the garbage collector discovers an object that is weakly reachable, the following occurs:
>
>1.  The **WeakReference** object's referent field is set to null, thereby making it not refer to the heap object any longer.
>2.  The heap object that had been referenced by the **WeakReference** is declared finalizable.
>3.  The **WeakReference object is added to its ReferenceQueue**. Then the heap object's finalize() method is run and its memory freed.

### Playground

**Source code**
```kotlin
class Foo

fun main() {

    var foo: Foo? = Foo()
    val queue = ReferenceQueue<Foo?>()
    val weakReference = WeakReference(foo, queue)

    fun print() {
        println("referant:\t\t${weakReference.get()}\nis enqueued:\t${weakReference.isEnqueued}\nqueue empty:\t${queue.poll() == null}")
    }

    fun gc() {
        println("--- GC ---")
        System.gc()
    }

    print()

    gc()
    print()

    foo = null
    Thread.sleep(1000)
    gc()
    print()
}
```
**Output**
```
referant:	Foo@28d93b30
is enqueued:	false
queue empty:	true
--- GC ---
referant:	Foo@28d93b30
is enqueued:	false
queue empty:	true
--- GC ---
referant:	null
is enqueued:	true
queue empty:	false
```

**What's happening here?**
1. First output is a safe check: we've got object stored in `WeakReference`, which in context of `Reference` is called **`referant`**, it's not enqueued for garbage collection and the `ReferenceQueue` is empty.
2. In the second block Garbage Collector is instructed to run but as we have **strong** reference to the `foo` object, running it doesn't change anything.
3. We loose strong reference to the `foo` so Garbage Collector can start its work. As presented, the refarnt has been collected, the reference has been enqueued to collection and the `ReferenceQueue` is not empty anymore

**Why Thread.sleep(1000)?**
> (...) even if  `WeakReference.get()`  returns  `null`  it is not guarantee that  `WeakReference.enqueue`  will be  `true`  or  `ReferenceQueue.poll`  wont return  `null`

Without giving some time for GC, we can see non deterministic results of setting reference as enqueued and putting it to the reference queue.

### Is it possible to get back collected object with `ReferenceQueue`?

> (...) with the ReferenceQ there is no way to reach the released java object

ðŸ‘†After setting `null` value on weakly referenced object and garbage collecting, we can poll the `WeakReference` object from `ReferenceQueue`. Although it's the same `WeakReference` object, it still points to `null` though we can't access it and re-initialize collected object:

**Source code**
```kotlin
class Foo

fun main() {
    var foo: Foo? = Foo()
    val queue = ReferenceQueue<Foo?>()
    val weakReference = WeakReference(foo, queue)

    foo = null
  System.gc()
    println("WeakReference points to:\t\t\t\t${weakReference.get()}")
    val lastItem = queue.poll()
    println("Last item on queue the same reference?:\t${weakReference == lastItem}")
    println("Does it point to original object?:\t\t${lastItem.get() != null}")
}
```

**Output**
```
WeakReference points to:                null
Last item on queue the same reference?:	true
Does it point to original object?:      false
```
