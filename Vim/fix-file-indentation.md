# Fix file indentation

To fix file indentation, you can simply go to beginning of the file (`gg`) and execute `=G`. 

I find it especially useful when working in Android with XML files that don't have parameters sorted. Formatting the file in Android Studio, using `CMD+ALT+L` would fix indentation, but also order of parameters in tags, making the diff more difficult to read.
